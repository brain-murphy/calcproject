Readme

First of all, be sure that everything has been compiled by following the instructions from the README for part 1.


To encode an input stream x to y, run encode.java.



To decode an input stream y to x, run decode.java. This file will require the user to manually insert in the y0 values and y1 values. It will output the number of iterations for Gauss Seidel and Jacobi and also will output the decoded stream.


To run Jacobi iteraton, run jacobi.java

To run Gauss-Seidel iteration, run gauss_seidel.java
