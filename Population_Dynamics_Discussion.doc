Urban Population Dynamics Analysis

1.) Interpret the data in the matrix, and discuss the social factors that influence those numbers.

	The top row of the Leslie Matrix contains the fecundicity of each age group, or how likely they are to produce
	offspring.  Obviously, the ages where females are most likely to bear children will be around the late teens, 
	upwards towards late forties which is exactly what the matrix shows.  The other values in the Leslie Matrix are
	the likelihood of survival for each age group.  In the first age group, shown by the first column, from ages 0-9,
	the survival rate is lower with a survival rate of .7.  This makes sense since there are many things that can go
	wrong during child birth and also since as babies are still developing, they are much more susceptible to disease
	and other issues.  The survival rate then increases to about .85-.9 during the ages of 10-50, as humans are reaching
	their peak physical form and are less likely to die from illness or injury.  However, as the ages increase from
	there, the likelihood of survival decreases and then nosedives to .40 at the 70-80 age group.  At these older ages,
	illnesses start to be more common, and even slight injuries or health issues could be fatal.


2.) What will the population distribution be in 2010? 2020? 2030? 2040? 2050? Calculate also the total population in those
	years, and by what fraction the total population changed each year. 

				Years	2010		2020		2030		2040		2050
	Age Group						
	0 – 9			635000		518750		816240		965648.5	1341322.675
	10 – 19			147000		444500		363125		571368		675953.95
	20 – 29			161500		124950		377825		308656.25	485662.8
	30 – 39			162000		145350		112455		340042.5	277790.625
	40 – 49			189000		145800		130815		101209.5	306038.25
	50 – 59			176000		166320		128304		115117.2	89064.36
	60 – 69			136000		140800		133056		102643.2	92093.76
	70 – 79			92400		104720		108416		102453.12	79035.264
	80 – 89			36000		36960		41888		43366.4		40981.248
							
	Total Population	1734900		1828150		2212124		2650504.67	3387942.932

	% increase 		22.18		5.37		21		19.82		27.8
	from last year

   

	To calculate these numbers, we raised the Leslie matrix to the n power, where n was the number 	of decades that
	passed, and multiplied that matrix by the initial population vector, x.
		x(n) = A^n * x(0), where x(0) is the initial population.
	To calculate the total population, we added up all numbers in the x vector which represented the population for
	each age group.  % increase in population was calculated by dividing the new population by the population from the
	previous decade.


3.) Use the power method to calculate the largest eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix A. The iteration of the power method
	should stop when you get 8 digits of accuracy. What does this tell you? Will the population go to zero, become stable,
	or be unstable in the long run? Discuss carefully and provide the mathematical arguments for your conclusion. You
	might want to investigate the convergence of ||Ak ||.

	The eigenvalue of the Leslie Matrix is 1.2886562.  This number tells you the percentage population growth that the
    	Leslie matrix will eventually converge to given enough years.  We know this because, ||AÂk|| converges to this
    	eigenvector and eigenvalue as k increases to infinity.  The population will continuously grow at a stable rate of
    	around 28.8%.  However, population would eventually get out of hand as the population increases and the population
    	growth continues to increase as well.


4.) Suppose we are able to decrease the birth rate of the second age group by half in 2020. What are the predictions for
	2030, 2040 and 2050? Calculate again the largest eigenvalue of A (to 8 digits of accuracy) with your program and
	discuss its meaning regarding the population in the long run.

    	If we were to decrease birth rate in 2020, the populations in 2010 and 2020 would be the same.  However, the
    	population in 2030 would drop to 1,767,974, 2040 would be 1,987,240, and 2050 would be 2,280,308.  The eigenvalue of
    	the new Leslie matrix would be 1.167902832734512, which would mean the growth of the population would converge to
    	around 16.78% per decade.
